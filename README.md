Create a Java application that uses reflection to analyse an arbitrary Java
Application Archive (JAR) and calculates one or more design and structural metrics for each
of the component classes in its object graph. You are free to use any number of or combination
of metrics, including LOCs, SLOC, CP, cyclomatic complexity, positional stability, CK metrics
and MOOD metrics.
