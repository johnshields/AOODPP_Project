#### *Measuring Software Design Quality Using the Reflection API* ...

### Research 

Reflection is an API which is used to examine or modify the behavior of methods, classes, interfaces at runtime.

* The required classes for reflection are provided under java.lang.reflect package.
* Reflection gives us information about the class to which an object belongs and also the methods of that class which can be executed by using the object.
* Through reflection we can invoke methods at runtime irrespective of the access specifier used with them. [1]
